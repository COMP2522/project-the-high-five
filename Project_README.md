This is a simple Tower Defense game created in Java. The objective of the game is to prevent enemies from reaching the right side of the game map by building towers that will shoot them down.

Gameplay

The game takes place on a 2D game map with a fixed path that the enemies will follow. The player has a set amount of money that they can use to buy and upgrade towers. The towers will automatically shoot at enemies as they move along the path. The player must strategically place their towers in order to prevent the enemies from reaching the end of the path.

In addition to the basic gameplay and installation instructions, this Tower Defense game has some specific features:

The UI class manages the user interface elements of a game. It contains methods for displaying the current level number, current score, number of enemies defeated, the player's current health using red and black hearts, and the player's current coins. The class also loads up UI elements such as coinImage, redHeart, and blackHeart. The displayHP method uses if-else statements to display a combination of red and black hearts depending on the player's current health. The displayText method displays text on the screen using a specified x and y coordinate. The constructor takes in a Window object for accessing the LevelManager and updating the game display. The setup method loads up the UI elements.

Individual Contributions

Cheryl

Database Handling: I implemented a database system that stores the player's high score and game state. The game now reads and writes this data at regular intervals to ensure that the player's progress is always saved and up-to-date. The game reads the JSON game data from the database when the game is loaded, allowing them to continue their game from where they left off.

Menu Screen: I created a user-friendly menu screen that allows the player to start a new game, load a saved game, or view the high scores. This menu screen is easy to navigate.

Non-Blocking Concurrent/Asynchronous Processing: I added a non-blocking concurrent/asynchronous processing system that runs at regular intervals to save game data in the background.

Persistent Data State: I incorporated a non-trivial persistent data state that saves the player's progress and game state in a JSON file. This ensures that the player's progress is always saved, even if they exit the game or shut down their computer.

Winning/Losing Screens: I created winning and losing screens that are displayed at the end of each game. These screens provide feedback to the player and allow them to submit their name and their highscore to the leaderboard.

Highscore Writing to the Database: I implemented a system that writes the player's high score to the database at the end of each game. This ensures that the high score list is always up-to-date and reflects the player's latest score.

Game State Persistence: I implemented a game state persistence system that ensures the player's progress is always saved and up-to-date. This system saves the game state to a file or database at regular intervals, ensuring that the player's progress is always up-to-date.

JSON Game Data: I designed and implemented a JSON game data structure that stores the player's progress and game state. This data structure includes information such as the player's high score, game level, tower upgrades, and enemy progress.

Writing Game Data to File: I implemented a system that writes the JSON game data to a local file. This system ensures that the player's progress is always saved and up-to-date, even if they exit the game or shut down their computer.

Reading Game Data from File: I created a system that reads the JSON game data from the local file as the game is playing. 

Aric 

Bullet: Implemented the Bullet and BulletManager classes. The Bullet has methods to move it and check whether it has hit a target or not. If a Bullet hits a target our goes out of bounds, the BulletManager removes it from the window. BulletManager also handles updating all the Bullets in the list. 

UI: I made the user interface elements of a game. I created methods for displaying the current level number, current score, number of enemies defeated, the player's current health using red and black hearts, and the player's current coins. 

In addition to the aforementioned contributions, I also created a robust suite of tests to ensure correct functionality of those classes. Furthermore, I contributed to troubleshooting wherever the game logic coincided with either the Bullets or the UI.

Quan

Path: Designed a custom data structure that hold Nodes which contain x and y coordinates on the screen. This class handles the path that Enemy would follow in the Level. Implemented several methods that simplify pathing designs.

Levels: I implemented Level superclass which is inherited by every Level of the Game. Level handles most of the gameplay logic: spawning Enemy, checking collision, placing Towers. 

LevelManager: I designed a class which manage every levels in the game. It handles level initialization and transistion.

Tile Checking System: I created a system to keep track of pernament object on the screen such as Path and Towers. This system allows the game to check Tower placement restrictions and make sure that nothing is placed in the wrong place. It also made sure that towers can be snap into desired placement.

Select Tower UI: Implemented a way for players to select and place tower in their desired place. This class uses the Tile Map system to check if a spot is available to place or not for the towers.

Path tracing method for Enemy: I made a tracking method to make Enemy follows the level's path. This method update the next x and y coordinate everytime the enemy has reach a specific position on the path. Accounted for direction change on the path.

Enemy removal: I implemented a way for enemy to delete themselves after going out of bound. This prevent spending necessary memory and computing power for enemy that is not visible to player.

Sprite Animation: Implemented methods that load and process a sprite sheet into an array of PImages. Then draw them at specific timings to create an illusion of animation. 

Tower's DTS (Detect, Track and Shoot) system: I developed a way for tower to detect any enemies within shooting range and track them based on a priority system that track the one that is the closest to its goal. Furthermore, I also implemented a cooldown after each time the tower shoot to balance the gameplay. After the cooldown and the Enemy(tracked) is still inside the shooting zone, the Tower will calculate an angle in relative to the enemy position to spawn a bullet that will fly toward the enemy.

Grid: Made a grid display for development purposes. This helped in placing pernament graphical object, alongside making pathing easier.

Beside the contributions mentioned above, I contributed greatly on implementing the general gameplay logic. In addition, I had a heavy hand in troubleshooting and debugging other members code.


Gursidh

Continously updated the UML to match the code as classes were being created.
Created the general methods in Tower, TowerManager, and Sprite as well as the interfaces these classes implemented.
Heavily contributed in moving the mouse and figuring out how to interact with the users mouse using mousePressed method.
Helped with visual aspects relating to towers animation.
Refactored the code to clean up messy code and create a system of classes in which the Manager classes control methods of the class its managing.
Continously cleaned up the code, added documentation, and made the code visually easier to understand.
Wrote test cases for some classes, including Tower and TowerManager, to make sure they are functioning as expected.

In addition to those tasks listed above, I was heavily involved in helping my teamates debug their code and talk through the issues they were facing. Refactoring my teamates code was one of the biggest way I contributed to this project.

For next week, you'll want to have a clear idea of what your project is going to be. Then, in the next lab, I will help you scope your project appropriately. In this repo, write the following:
1.	A one-liner (exactly 1 sentence) that describes your project.
Our group is planning to create a tower defense simulator consisting of enemy entities following a predestined path where they will systematically encounter the player’s “towers” trying to impede their movement. 
2.	A list of points (about 5-10 sentences) that describes how your project meets each of the requirement criteria.
-	We will use the processing.org libraries to create visual interfaces. Our game will have a visual interface to represent a map, characters, and enemies.
-	We are going to write test cases to ensure the game is working as we intended it to
-	We will save our game state in a database. (wave, points after every wave)
-	Our group will be documenting all the meetings, so we are aware of progress and keep ourselves within the scope. This will be done by having good commit messages, writing process reports…
3.	Answers to the below group discussion items (meetings, communication, roles, and expectations).
A large portion of your mark for this course will be work that you do within the context of a group. My expectations are that all group members contribute fully to the best of their abilities. Since everyone will have different abilities, preferences, and interests, this can sometimes be difficult to negotiate.
1.	Every group member must be on a common chat application, and must check and respond to messages within a day during normal business hours.
2.	Every group member must volunteer to take on project tasks and complete them by the associated deadlines. These tasks MUST be managed using GitHub issues. Each group member is responsible for creating and closing GitHub issues for tasks they have taken on.
3.	The group must meet at least once during the week outside of class time to discuss the status of project tasks. All group members must be present during this meeting.
4.	For official/important decision-making meetings, an ongoing minutes document must be maintained where attendance and group decisions are recorded.
5.	Groups must decide on a way of formally negotiating disputes. Default will be consensus with 2/3rds majority vote unless another system is explicitly decided upon.
If there are disputes that require mediation from me, I will be happy to help the group find a solution that is amenable to all. In your first group meeting, you will want to discuss the following:
1.	Meeting time and format: when will you meet and how?
a.	Monday after class, and Wednesdays if needed. Both in person.
2.	Communications expectations and format: what times of day are people available and by which medium?
a.	Efficient communication via Discord with an expectation of one business day to reply.
3.	Roles and responsibilities: who will do what part of the group aspects of the project, including project management?
a.	Facilitator • Moderates team discussions • Keeps the group on task • Ensures equal involvement • Ensures equal opportunities to learn, participate and earn respect 
-	Cheryl 
b.	Recorder • Distributes and hands in materials • Completes worksheets, written assignments or summaries for oral reports 
-	Aric 
c.	Reporter • Summarizes the group’s activities or conclusions • Assists the recorder with writing worksheets and group reports 
-	Victor 
d.	Timekeeper • Keeps the group aware of time constraints • Aids the facilitator in keeping the team on task • Consults with other teams if needed • Leaves the work area in good condition • Fills in for an absent member if there is no fifth member 
-	Gursidh
e.	Wild card • Fills in for an absent member
-	Quan
4.	Abilities and expectations: how much effort do people want to put into the project and in what areas do they have expertise?
a.	Our group is aiming for an A grade

Gursidh's Individual Pitch
Create a Tower class that implements a Tower Manager superclass. The Tower Manager will handle all the Tower objects. In addition, Tower will also implement the abstract class Sprite which also implements Collidable. Will also be creating the UI Manager class alongside Victor which is connected to Window. 
Link to my individual UML: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/66d6bb77-2ee2-492b-8749-46daf81ce463/edit?invitationId=inv_56290ed1-47ee-4efd-a527-bb2c8e1baaca&page=0_0#

Victor's Individual Pitch
Create a Enemy class, as well as a Enemy Manager class. The Enemy Manager will manage all the Enemy objects and store them in an array. Also, Enemy will implement abstract class Sprite, as well as the interfaces Collidable and Movable. Finally, create levels 3 to 5 alongside with Quan. 
Link to my individual UML: https://lucid.app/lucidchart/dceae253-d48a-4638-9fd2-3562ea5fa071/edit?beaconFlowId=D28BF4163CD052FB&invitationId=inv_97bfffd1-b9fa-49f5-b9ee-047342d68bb4&page=0_0#

In Class Check:
Cheryl's parts are approved and we should be able to keep re-writing data to the database as the player keeps playing the game. Gursidh and Victor should split the collidable interface, as well as working on their own classes, because Enemy and Tower will be the classes that implement this interface the most. Aric should continue his tasks but should be in charge of UI manager instead of Gursidh and Victor splitting it. Quan's tasks are approved as well.
